# Local Router Site

This repo is for a website I am building as a personal project to act as a garage door opener, closer, and status checker.

This is a Django app that will be hosted on the local server and accept users' button pushes to use Raspberry Pi pins to power a relay and activate the door.

Everything on this site I have written myself.
